## A known 'issue'

Because the **Edit Project Files** menu works for all kinds of projects, include .NETCore projects which have the VS built-in Edit Project menu.
If you edit a .NETCore project via this menu then edit it via the VS built-in menu (vice versa), then two edit windows will be opened.

## Thanks

Thanks for every rating, I'm glad the tool is helpful to you,
because of a [network issue](https://github.com/heku/Kool.VsDiff/issues/5),
I cannot reply to you directly in the marketplace.
